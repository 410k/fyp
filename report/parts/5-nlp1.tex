\section{ScienceIE Subtask 1 - Key Phrase Extraction}
A section all about what I did for part 1 (probably will be the longest section)
\subsection{Method 1: Support Vector Machine}
Go through making the SVM and what tests helped a lot. 
As part 2 has already been described, I think it makes sense here to mention I tried adapting this slightly for task 2 but that it went terribly.
\subsection{Method 2: Clustering}
Talk about the experimentation with clustering.
