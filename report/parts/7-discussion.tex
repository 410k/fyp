\chapter{Conclusion}
Overall, the solutions presented to the ScienceIE problem do not succeed in beating the solutions proposed as part of the task, however, do explore other idea about how to achieve them. Word2Vec usage in particular was explored and utilised through the solutions provided to all three subtasks. A more suitable model for Word2Vec would have been useful and likely boosted the performance of the systems. The reason for creating these systems is to extract classified key pieces of information from scientific papers, and a use for this was proposed and demonstrated in the proof-of-concept website produced. This used key phrase information when completing search to try to prioritise relevant papers to a users query, which was reasonably fast and accurate, given the data available.
