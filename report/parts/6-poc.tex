\chapter{Creating a Proof of Concept Use for ScienceIE data}
Having completed systems to handle the information extraction, the next major part of the project was to explore how this information can be utilised for researchers. 

The most obvious domain for using summary information about a set of resources is search. Being able to efficiently search through a large set of documents to quickly find more useful information is a very useful thing.

\section{Further Research}
