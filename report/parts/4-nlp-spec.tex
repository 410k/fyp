\section{The ScienceIE Task: Design and Implementation}

To complete the ScienceIE task, three systems would need to be created to handle each sub task. 

\subsection{Data Preprocessing}

\subsection{Subtask A - Key Phrase Extraction}
A section all about what I did for part 1
\subsubsection{Method 1: Support Vector Machine}
Go through making the SVM and what tests helped a lot. 
As part 2 has already been described, I think it makes sense here to mention I tried adapting this slightly for task 2 but that it went terribly.
\subsubsection{Method 2: Clustering}
Talk about the experimentation with clustering.

\subsection{ScienceIE Subtask B - Key Phrase Classification}
A section all about what I did for part 2
\subsubsection{Word2Vec Classification}
Talk about using word2vec to simply find a good way to quickly classify key phrases with decent results.
*** Where do I fit the SVM for this, as not worth a whole section

\subsection{ScienceIE Subtask C - Relation Extraction}
A section all about what I did for part 3
\subsubsection{Support Vector Machine}
Discuss the SVM I tried to do this with (including Word2Vec)
