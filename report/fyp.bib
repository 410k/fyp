As the term implies, TF-IDF calculates values for each word in a document through an inverse proportion of the frequency of the word in a particular document to the percentage of documents the word appears in. Words with high TF-IDF numbers imply a strong relationship with the document they appear in, suggesting that if that word were to appear in a query, the document could be of interest to the user. We provide evidence that this simple algorithm efficiently categorizes relevant words that can enhance query retrieval.},

Therefore, most algorithms and systems aimed to help people perform automatic keywords extraction have been proposed. Conditional Random Fields (CRF) model is a state-of-the-art sequence labeling method, which can use the features of documents more sufficiently and effectively. At the same time, keywords extraction can be considered as the string labeling. In this paper, keywords extraction based on CRF is proposed and implemented. As far as we know, using CRF model in keyword extraction has not been investigated previously. Experimental results show that the CRF model outperforms other machine learning methods such as support vector machine, multiple linear regression model etc. in the task of keywords extraction.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Support Vector Machines (SVMs) provide a powerful method for classification (supervised learning). Use of SVMs for clustering (unsupervised learning) is now being considered in a number of different ways.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nRESULTS: An SVM-based clustering algorithm is introduced that clusters data with no a priori knowledge of input classes. The algorithm initializes by first running a binary SVM classifier against a data set with each vector in the set randomly labelled, this is repeated until an initial convergence occurs. Once this initialization step is complete, the SVM confidence parameters for classification on each of the training instances can be accessed. The lowest confidence data (e.g., the worst of the mislabelled data) then has its' labels switched to the other class label. The SVM is then re-run on the data set (with partly re-labelled data) and is guaranteed to converge in this situation since it converged previously, and now it has fewer data points to carry with mislabelling penalties. This approach appears to limit exposure to the local minima traps that can occur with other approaches. Thus, the algorithm then improves on its weakly convergent result by SVM re-training after each re-labeling on the worst of the misclassified vectors - i.e., those feature vectors with confidence factor values beyond some threshold. The repetition of the above process improves the accuracy, here a measure of separability, until there are no misclassifications. Variations on this type of clustering approach are shown.$\backslash$n$\backslash$nCONCLUSION: Non-parametric SVM-based clustering methods may allow for much improved performance over parametric approaches, particularly if they can be designed to inherit the strengths of their supervised SVM counterparts.},

Our method generalizes earlier work that had relied on using small numbers of hand-crafted regular expression patterns to identify hyper- nym pairs. Using “dependency path” features extracted from parse trees, we introduce a general-purpose formalization and generalization of these patterns. Given a training set of text containing known hypernym pairs, our algorithm automatically extracts useful dependency paths and applies them to new corpora to identify novel pairs.

Although this was a new task, we had a total of 26 submissions across 3 evaluation scenarios. We expect the task and the findings reported in this paper to be relevant for researchers working on understanding scientific content, as well as the broader knowledge base population and information extraction communities.},

{\textperiodcentered}        Other decent results (F1 {\~{}} 0.25) used SVM classifier on provided training data to classify phrases and used a CRF to predict labels of the phrases. 
{\textperiodcentered}        Task 3 had RNN  based approaches working well (up to F1 0.6) 
{\textperiodcentered}        Generally, it's best to use RNNs, in combination with CRFs

abstract = {We present a method for characterizing a research work in terms of its focus, do- main of application, and techniques used. We show how tracing these aspects over time provides a novel measure of the in- fluence of research communities on each other. We extract these characteristics by matching semantic extraction patterns, learned using bootstrapping, to the depen- dency trees of sentences in an article's abstract. We combine this information with pre-calculated article-to-community assignments to study the influence of a community on others in terms of tech- niques borrowed and the ‘maturing' of some communities to solve other prob- lems. As a case study, we show how the computational linguistics community and its sub-fields have changed over the years with respect to their foci, methods used, and domain problems. For instance, we show that part-of-speech tagging and parsing have increasingly been adopted as tools for solving problems in other do- mains. We also observe that speech recog- nition and probability theory have had the most seminal influence.},
annote = {{\textperiodcentered}        Used dependency trees 
{\textperiodcentered}        We extract the phrase corresponding to the matched phrase-tree and label it with the pattern's category.

annote = {{\textperiodcentered}        Task gets harder the longer the doc as more candidates (papers are long{\ldots}) 
{\textperiodcentered}        “a scientific paper typically has at least 10 keyphrases and hundreds of candidate keyphrases, yielding a much bigger search space”

{\textperiodcentered}        Usually, approaches are

2.      Determine using either 
{\S}  Unsupervised learning 
{\S}  Supervised learning 
{\textperiodcentered}        Section 3.(1, 2, 3) describes the above note

{\textperiodcentered}        Unsupervised approaches 
o   Graph based approaches 
o   Clustering 
{\S}  Eg clusters semantically similar candidate using Wikipedia and co-occurrence-based statistics 
{\S}  Consider importance of topics/clusters (do all need a key phrase representation?) 
o   LMA scores a candidate keyphrase based on two features, namely, phraseness (i.e., the extent to which a word sequence can be treated as a phrase) and informativeness (i.e., the extent to which a word sequence captures the central idea of the document it appears in). Intuitively, a phrase that has high scores for phraseness and informativeness is likely to be a keyphrase. 
{\textperiodcentered}        “not observe any significant difference between the types of errors made by the four systems other than the fact that the supervised system has the expected tendency to predict keyphrases seen in the training data.” 
{\textperiodcentered}        Errors: 
o   Overgeneration (28-37{\%} of errors) 
{\S}  Picks a keyword, but also other words as they contain the key words 
o   Infrequency errors 
{\S}  Key phrase is so infrequent, it isn't selected 
o   Redundancy errors 
{\S}  Outputting alias of key phrases + key phrase 
o   Evaluation errors 
{\S}  Problems with evaluation programs 
{\textperiodcentered}        Recommendations: 
o   See section 5.2 
{\textperiodcentered}        Similarity is often gained through co-occurrence information

abstract = {Keyphrases are an important means of document summarization, clustering, and topic search. Only a small minority of documents have author-assigned keyphrases, and manually assigning keyphrases to existing documents is very laborious. Therefore it is highly desirable to automate the keyphrase extraction process. This paper shows that a simple procedure for keyphrase extraction based on the naive Bayes learning scheme performs comparably to the state of the art. It goes on to explain how this procedure's performance can be boosted by automatically tailoring the extraction process to the particular document collection at hand. Results on a large collection of technical reports in computer science show that the qualit y of the extracted keyphrases improves significantly when domain-specific information is exploited.},
