# tbc452's FYP: Extracting Key Phrases and Relations from Scientific Publications

Taking on the [ScienceIE](https://scienceie.github.io/) task.

## Set up and run
### Prerequisites
* Java 8 (64-bit)
* Maven 3
* For Word2Vec, some [pretrained models](https://github.com/3Top/word2vec-api) (download `Google News` as a minumum).
* It likely works on other Linuxs and probably on Windows if you put enough effort in, although the development and execution was all completed on Ubuntu 16.04.

### Running the system
The 2 Java projects under the [`java`](java) directory are [`FYP-NLP`](java/FYP-NLP), which includes all NLP code, and [`FYP-GUI`](java/FYP-GUI), which includes the GUI code making the project usable as a service. Scripts are provided for convenience:

| Java Project | Script | Description |
|--------------|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FYP-NLP | `./build.sh` | Compiles the system, without running any tests. |
| FYP-NLP | `./install.sh` | Compiles the system, without running any tests, and installs the project to the local Maven repository. |
| FYP-NLP | `./test.sh <test class>` | Compiles the system and runs the JUnit test class given. |
| FYP-GUI | `./build.sh` | Compiles the GUI and runs all JUnit tests. |
| FYP-GUI | `./build-and-run.sh` | Compiles the GUI, without running any tests, and launches the GUI. |
| FYP-GUI | `./run.sh` | Launches the GUI (assumes it is already built). |

## Current Status of Software

In terms of NLP...
* For Task 1, the existing SVM is doing fine, and I think is about ready to leave alone. Official scripts give up to ~0.21 which isn't as good as the achievements at ScienceIE but good enough for me, especially when compared with my own evaluation which is a little fairer. Clustering was atempted (using Word2Vec to help calculate distance) but this didn't seem to be very good, usually making just 1 giant cluster which swallowed up single tokens at a time.
* For Task 2, the existing method of using Word2Vec with a simple averaging algorithm seems fairly effective (over 50% of classification on gold data is correct). SVM usage was also attempted inherited from task 1, but proven to be not very good - no surprises there!.
* For Task 3, the existing SVM using Word2Vec is not very good at all. A limited number of words appear in WordNet meaning that may not be a way to work on this task either. A rule engine is expensive to build and probably unachievable, although potentially dynamic searching of Wikipedia/Freebase (resources used by the best solution at SemEval 2017) may be a good solution to at least produce some good output. Also attempted a slightly different SVM using Word2Vec and vector distances/angels, but did not improve.

In terms of making the system into a product...
* A GUI has been constructed, allowing submission and automatic analysis of papers (although currently the paper already has to be on the local system to work, web extraction has not been completed).
* Bootstrap makes it look quite nice!
* Papers can be viewed (with key phrases drawn on) and annotations downloaded. Hyponym/synoym viewing on the webpage isn't shown, as no good solution could be found - although it makes extremely little difference.
* The search page shows papers well, and search is reasonably effective.

## The Dissertation and Presentation

The dissertation is being completed in the [`report`](report) directory, and the [current PDF version can be viewed here](report/fyp.pdf).

The presentation is [`Presentation.pdf`](Presentation.pdf).
