Taking on the [ScienceIE](https://scienceie.github.io/) task.

## Set up and run
### Prerequisites
* Java 8+ (64-bit)
* Maven (if building)

### What to run
* To evaluate the current SVM performance, run test class `xyz.tomclarke.fyp.nlp.svm.TestSVMProcessor`
* To evaluate current clustering performance with Word2Vec, run test class `xyz.tomclarke.fyp.nlp.cluster.TestW2VCluster`
	* To run using the Google News corpus, you may need to set the following JVM arguments: `-Xms1024m -Xmx10g`

## Results
The current SVM performance evaluated by this system is:
```
